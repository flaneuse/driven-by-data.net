title: Distances To Nuclear Reactors
info: 'After Fukoshima, everybody was talking about evacuation radii. This series of maps show different countries regions within 100km of a nuclear reactor (pro tip: you want to live in the green zone).'

Shortly after the Fukoshima catastrophy in March 2011 I was very interested in the geographic patterns of nuclear power. This map series simply divides the area of a country in regions that are closer than 100km to an active nuclear reactor (red) and those who are not (green).

This idea formed the basis of an [interactive infographic](/2011/03/16/zeit-nuclear/) I created for ZEIT ONLINE a few days later.
