title: Visualizing Plagiarism in Guttenberg's PhD
info: All text lines in the dissertation of Germany’s former Minister of Defense Guttenberg. Created in about 1 hour, based on the data collected by the folks at Guttenplag Wiki. Published a day before the minister finally resigned from office (good timing!).
