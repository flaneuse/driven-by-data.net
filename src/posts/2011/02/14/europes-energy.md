The 'Europe's Energy' project gives users a set of visual tools to put the European Energy targets into context and to understand and compare how progress is being made towards them in different countries.

It was developed in collaboration with the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org) and has been showcased at a meeting of the European Commission.

_Update (March 2012)_

The visualization has won a silver medal in the category innovative format at the Malofiej20 Infographic World Summit.
