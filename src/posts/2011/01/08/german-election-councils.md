Simple form study of German election districts. Natural reaction of me discovering the beautiful shapes of U.S. gerrymandering for the first time.

**Update** while I was putting the project on this website I couldn't resist but make an updated version with the shapes all the same size and packed into a shape of Germany. Original screenshot below. (Feb 2016)
