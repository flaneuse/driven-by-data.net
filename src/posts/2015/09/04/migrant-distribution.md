Following the graphic about asylum applications, this [series of graphics and maps]({{ link }}) compared the actual share of accepted asylum application with a resettlement distribution key that the European Commission proposed in May.

While this (largely on population and GDP based) key has not yet been adopted as quota system for all refugees — the plan in May was limited to distribute 20,000 refugees over two years –, the comparison still indicates what countries are currently taking a greater share than others.
