As part of a longer series about the American middle class, a group of New York Times reporters and data journalists analized employment statistics ranging of over a span of 30 years, which revealed that it are [mostly women who benefited](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/business/economy/health-care-opens-middle-class-path-taken-mainly-by-women.html?ref=topics) from the shifts in middle class jobs.

My part of this project was to find a [visual form]({{ link }}) for this data that could help telling this story in a different way. I ended up using small multiple slope graphs with gradient strokes.

This is the one and only graphic for which I did the print version first, a giant monster filling an entire double truck (see below). And before you're asking, nope, this doesn't work on mobile at all..
