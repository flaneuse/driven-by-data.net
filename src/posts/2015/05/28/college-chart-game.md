After obtaining a unique dataset that gave new insights on how the likelyhood of college attendance correlates to parental income, my colleages Amanda Cox and Kevin Quealy had the idea that the surprising nature of this correlation is more compelling after one has been forced to think about it first.

So instead of just showing a chart, we [built a tool]({{ link }}) that did exactly that: asking the reader to draw _what they think_ the relation between college attendance and parental income would be. After submitting their guess, we presented the actual relationship: a strikingly straight line, followed by.

Finally, the piece also showed the aggregation of all reader submissions live on the page, as they were coming in.

In a [follow-up piece](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/02/upshot/gauging-income-and-college-prospects-how-our-readers-did.html) on the next day Kevin analyzed how our readers did.

_Update:_ This piece won Gold and Best Of Show at [Malofjie 24](https://www.malofiejgraphics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/M24_-AWARDS-LIST_OK.pdf).
