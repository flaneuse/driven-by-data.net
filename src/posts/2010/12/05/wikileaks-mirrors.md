This visualization shows how the network of Wikileaks mirror server evolves after the blocking of wikileaks.org in many countries around the world. The servers are geo-located using MaxMinds GeoCityLite database. The conntections are computed using a Voronoi graph.

I was able to create this interactive map in a few hours because I was working on a Flash-based mapping framework at the same time.
