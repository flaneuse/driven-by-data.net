This update to our election [model](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html) [pages](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/senate-election-forecast.html) adds little sparklines that show (and [link to](/2016/09/09/state-election-forecasts.html)) the states where the race has shifted the most over the last 14 days.

The [tweet](https://twitter.com/driven_by_data/status/776486342872170500) I sent to announce the update provoked an interesting [debate](https://twitter.com/albertocairo/status/776800929492377600) about the usefulness of sparklines in general and some rare insight into the [debate culture](https://twitter.com/EdwardTufte/status/776715014841458688) of the datavis community on Twitter.
