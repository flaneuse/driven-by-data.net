The visualization shows the closeness of coalition parties at roll-call votes in the German Bundestag. The more closed a faction vote, the closer the symbols move to the center. This way one can quickly find votes, where members were freed from their party discipline, such as the CDU/CSU MPs on issues of genetic engineering.
