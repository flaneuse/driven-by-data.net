For showing all Chicago police officers that had civilian complaints against them, we used a slightly modified [circle packing algorithm](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1893974) to represent each officer with a sized circle. The resulting layout was then [exported as SVG](), annotated in Illustrator and exported using [ai2html](http://ai2html.org/).
