A series of [small multiple charts](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/28/world/europe/countries-under-strain-from-european-migration-crisis.html#charts) showing monthly numbers of asylum applications in European countries, both as absolute numbers and normalized by population.

The comparison shows that while Germany received the most migrant applications in absolute numbers, other countries like Sweden or Hungary are receiving far more applications per 100,000 inhabitants.
